# WebGL-Loop-Subdivision

## Overview
WebGL-Loop-Subdivision is a project that demonstrates several key features related to 3D mesh manipulation and visualization using WebGL. This project allows you to load mesh elements from Collada files, switch between objects, display mesh outlines, and perform Loop subdivision.

## Features
- Load mesh elements from Collada files.
- Easily switch between different objects using Key 1 and Key 2.
- Display outlines of meshes with a simple click of Key 7.
- Implement Loop subdivision for refining mesh geometry by pressing Key 8.

## Getting Started

### Build
Run the following command from the project's root folder:
- python make-skinning.py
### Running the Application
1. Start an HTTP server with the following command from the project's root folder:
- http-server dist -c-1

2. If successful, you will receive a confirmation message that the server is running.

3. Launch the application by opening your web browser and navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

## Enjoy Exploring!
