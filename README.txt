Topic: loop subdivision
Features:
1. Load mesh element in collada file.
2. Switch objects in Key 1 and Key 2.
3. Show outlines of meshes (Clicking Key 7).
4. Loop subdivision implementation (Clicking Key 8).

Limitation:
1. Loop subdivision may be slow. It may take at least 20 seconds each time if keeping loop subdivision.
2. No handling to sharp creases. ( I tried but still had bugs that cannot be fixed in time.)

Build instruction:
Using the code scheme of Virtual Mannequin project.

Build
make-skinning.py from the folder that contains it (the project root folder).

http-server dist -c-1

If successful, you should get a confirmation message that the server is now running. You can then launch the app by pointing your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080.



Dear Etienne,

I hope this message finds you well. The D&A staff has advised me to register with D&A to receive accommodations. I will try my best to complete the registration process as soon as possible, but it may not be possible to do so within the next few days. I regret not noticing this resource earlier and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you for giving me this chance.

Additionally, I wanted to inquire if the total late days can be accounted for just one assignment. From my understanding, the late days will be utilized in a manner that maximizes the final course grade. I appreciate any clarification you can provide on this matter.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

Ta-Che
